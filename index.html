            <div class="faq-container">
                <h3>Getting Started</h3>
                <div class="faq-item">
                    <p class="question">How do I add a subject to my profile?</p>
                    <p class="answer">From the Home screen, scroll down and tap the "Add a New Subject" card. You will be guided through selecting your exam board, qualification, and subject. Once added, it will appear on your Home screen.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="faq-item">
                    <p class="question">How do I mark my first paper?</p>
                    <p class="answer">Navigate to a subject from the Home screen. On the Subject screen, tap the "Mark a Paper" button in the bottom tab bar. You will be prompted to upload a PDF of the question paper and the corresponding markscheme. Our AI will then analyze it for you.</p>

                <div class="faq-item">
                    <p class="question">What is "The Ascent" and how does it work?</p>
                    <p class="answer">The Ascent is our gamified progress system! You "climb" virtual mountains by completing revision sessions. Go to the Progress tab to select a mountain challenge. The more you revise, the higher you climb!</p>

                <h3>Marking & Analysis</h3>
                <div class="faq-item">
                    <p class="question">What is the difference between an "Official" and "Unofficial" paper?</p>
                    <p class="answer">When confirming your paper details, linking to an "Official" paper allows us to compare your score against real grade boundaries. "Unofficial" papers are for materials like mock exams or topic-specific practice where official boundaries are not available.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="faq-item">
                    <p class="question">My paper has been "Processing" for a long time. What should I do?</p>
                    <p class="answer">Large or complex papers can take several minutes to process. If it seems stuck for more than 15 minutes, please try dismissing the upload and trying again. If the issue persists, contact our support team.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="faq-item">
                    <p class="question">The AI made a mistake in the analysis. Can I fix it?</p>
                    <p class="answer">Yes. From the Paper Detail screen, tap on a topic to view its details. From there, tap the pencil icon in the header to go to the "Edit Topic" screen. You can add, remove, or edit incorrectly marked questions to manually correct the analysis and your score.</p>
                </div>
